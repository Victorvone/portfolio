									<h1>Hey there, and thank you for visiting my website! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
                  My name is Victor. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience.
                  My journey began in my bachelor's degree, where I first heard about neural networks, and was mesmerized by this concept.
                  Since then, I have taught myself to code and gathered knowledge on the data realm, be it through books, courses youtube videos or podcasts.
                  I hold a bachelor's degree in Psychology and Neuroscience and a master's degree in Psychology. Here, my passion
                  for working with data and applying rigorous scientific methodology to generate insights has grown.
                  Through my experience in clinical and neuroscientific research at CharitÃ© Berlin, I have learned a lot and developed a strong passion for using data to improve the life of other people.
                  Lately, I participated in a data science bootcamp to further strengthen my skills and knowledge of coding and machine learning techniques.
                  Before that, I was working in software engineering and led a team of QA engineers at Sharpist, a tech company dedicated to the personal and professional growth of employees.
                  My personal ambitions are to work on exciting projects that extend my knowledge and skills of machine learning techniques,
                  coding, and neuroscience on a practical and scientific level. I am using this webpage to document my journey and share my projects with others.
                  I hope you find inspiration from my work and connect with me through the links to my social profiles provided on the main page.<br><br>
                  Until then, have fun reading!<br>
                  Cheers,<br>
                  Victor
